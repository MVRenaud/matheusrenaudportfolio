# matheusrenaudportfolio

## My name is Matheus Vegele Renaud & I'm a fullstack developer.
#### After finishing the theory part of my course at DCI. I posted my Portfolio with most of language, libraries and tools I learn during the course.
#### The Loghome page I finshed on the first part of the course using HTML, SCSS & bootstrap.
#### For my final backend project I developted the backend with Node.js, using express.js, axios, noSQL, mongoDB,Passport-jwt, bcrypt and jsonwebtoken.
#### Then I updated the Loghome file to React and greated the other components, pages and util. I used axios to fetch from backend.
